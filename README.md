So, you know that feeling of uncertainty? Is the Metalurgy Tartarite pickaxe better or worse than the Galacticraft Desh pickaxe? That's not even taking into account the Thermal Expansion Invar pickaxe, the Mekanism pickaxes. . . Oh yeah, Mekanism, what about paxels?!

This mod adds one simple thing, a tooltip visible on tools when SHIFT is pressed that tells you a tool's Max Durability, Efficiency, Harvest Level and Enchantability. It will even display information for each tool type for multi-tools like paxels.

Downloads can be found on the TheToolTooltipTool Releases page.

Installing the mod is the same as other Forge mods, drop it into your mods folder and go. It should be compatible with all 1.7.10 Forge versions from 1208 on. 

If you find a bug, feel free to report it in the GitHub Issue tracker. Alternatively, create a pull request, just note I can be a bit picky about coding style uniformity sometimes.

This mod is released under a BSD 2-Clause license, which means you're free to use it in a mod-pack without asking. It would be nice to know if you do though. Even though the license technically allow it, I would prefer you not make money off this mod, something to do with crying puppies and drug addled kittens. . .
